    $heroku login

    $heroku create [app_name]

    $git push heroku master

The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:

    $ heroku ps:scale web=1
Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website as follows:

    $ heroku open
    
    $heroku logs --tail
